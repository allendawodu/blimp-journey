She might have some important information for me about the tomb.

npc: That stubborn Martin!\
He rushed in despite my explicit warnings!\
Now he's been trapped for three days inside that deadly tomb.\
Look.\
I've dedicated my career to safe, methodical archaeology.\
And I can't risk my team's lives for one man's obsession.\
But you look capable.

I admire his passion, but not his recklessness.\
Please, you're his only hope now.

label archaeologist_1
npc: Dr. Shelby and Martin are like oil and water.\
He gave up everything to find this tomb.\
His position at the university, his family...\
She calls it foolish, he calls it dedication.

label archaeologist_2
npc: Dr. Shelby's all about playing it safe.\
Martin? He'd jump into a volcano for discovery.\
Which, I guess, is exactly what he did!

label archaeologist_3
npc: You know what's wild?\
Dr. Shelby used to be Martin's star student!\
Now she runs the department while he's the "crazy tomb guy."\
Life's funny that way, isn't it?

	I wonder if they know what he's doing out here.

Dr. Shelby insisted - though all we've treated so far is sunburn!

Martin's like "hold my coffee, watch this!"\
Two VERY different approaches to archaeology!

Sometimes you need to take risks.\
Just... maybe not volcano-sized ones.

Those murals at the beginning though...\
They suggest there are more tombs like this!

	Maybe... maybe some things are worth holding onto.\
	Thank you for bringing them back to me.

He really believed in this place when no one else did.\
Gotta respect the man's conviction!

The jungle tomb had us running from ever-growing vines!\
Tomb technology is crazy~!

She could use some of his courage...\
And he could definitely use some of her caution!

	I think he'd appreciate that.\
	Especially after all the flak he went through to find this place.
else:
	npc: Kinda makes you think about priorities, doesn't it?\
	Adventure's great, but so is having someone to come home to.

Nothing a good meal and rest won't fix.\
Though the "I told you so" from Dr. Shelby might sting worse!
